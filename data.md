The csv file was put into a csv to json converter and from the link below is where I got the final JSON format for 
this project.

The original Csv came from a site called kaggle.com link is below to the exact dataset.

  The Dataset that I used for this was a list of the top 16,600 video games sold in the world, but I am only using the first 150 videogames for simplicity sake. Each game has a regional sales number and a global sales number, and also on what gaming system it was sold for. But i did not use all of the fields in the chart.
